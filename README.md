# UFOs

## Overview of Project 
  Dana would like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time on her webpage.     Her previous webpage only filtered using dates. In addition to the date, she wanted to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results
  In adding multiple filters on the webpage, users are now allowed to filter table data by city, state, country, shape and date. 
  In order to do this, there are 5 input fields on the UFO sightings page. All the user has to do is enter a date, a location (city, state, country) and a 
  shape, and the results will show up on the table.
  
  
## Summary 
  In summary, this has been a very helpful addition to Dana's webpage. However, there is one drawback to this new design. There are placeholder variables 
  set into each input field. It is not possible to search for only one of the filters at a time. You must enter all the different filters, or the original   placeholder choice will remain in the filter. So to make this webpage a bit more functional, I would say creating a way to erase different input fields     and only filter one different field at a time would be very helpful. Another way to enhance this webpage would be to add images to the table as well. It   it would be very cool to add images, especially for the shapes category of the table, that way it adds a more visual component to the webpage.
